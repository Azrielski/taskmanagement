## File accessing

once you visit the public repo, you will see one folder and 5 files. Fork and clone, once all that is done open vs code and access the project's functionality by writing "python cli.py".

## File Structure

- `cli.py`: Main script to run the task management system.
- `crud.py`: Handles data operations (create, read, update, delete).

Happy grading.
